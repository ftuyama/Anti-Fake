<p>What I found most interesting about these tests were the subtle differences in "look" (I always presumed that each used a different antilogarithm, but I never imagined they would differ in so many subtle ways). Choosing a render engine appears to much like choosing a camera, each has its own look and feel, as well as technical and cost draw backs.</p>

<p>Agreed. Not sure if it's because it's most familiar, but the Cycles renders looked consistently good (except maybe for the hair), whereas the others seemed to have obvious strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Interesting comparison, would it be possible to see the renders without the heavy jpeg compression? It's difficult to see the noise.</p><p>For the car render, Mitsuba seems clearly the winner. I disagree that the Octane and V-Ray renders are equally noise free, the Octane render has a lot of noise in indirect light, and the V-Ray render has a lot of noise in edges and sharp speculars.</p><p>For the interior, enabling multiple importance sampling on lamps would have probably resolve those fireflies on the lamp in Cycles. The appealing indirect illumination in V-Ray is purely due to a different light setup, the other renderers can render the same thing if they were set up the same.</p><p>The hair renders is difficult to judge, the Cycles renders looks like it has a lot less noise in depth of field, so the render time could have been lower to compare with the other renderers. But overall the comparison seems impossible, different hair shapes an shaders and the different light setups have a big effect on render time. I expect all renderers can achieve a look similar to Maxwell, though it may be more difficult to set up.</p>

<p>So I just have to ask about an important missing fact: what did you use to determine how long the renders ran?  Was it a particular sample count?  Was it subjective 'image quality'?</p><p>Also, on the engines that have multiple integrators, which did you use for each image?  Sorry to nitpick but if you want to make a legitimate comparison between the renderers you need to be more upfront with how you did it......Just saying :)</p>

<p>Hey man, it’s ok to ask questions.</p><p>In some cases I could chose the "image quality" by setting a<br>noise threshold (in Luxrender and Vray for example), but in most cases<br>it was a subjective choice.</p><p>Comparing samples wasn’t an option (man, I wish I could have done it<br>that way!). Cycles, LuxR, Octane and Mitsuba have somewhat similar rendering<br>settings, but Maxwell and Vray are just too different in the way you set your rendering settings.</p><p>Indeed I had in mind which integrators worked better, and of course I<br>also had the samplers in mind. As I stated, it involved a lot of testing and<br>reading each renderer’s documentation. Once you do that it’s fairly simple to<br>narrow down your options, find a couple of integrator+sampler combinations<br>suited for your scene and just render and compare which combination gives<br>better results.</p><p>I thought of putting the settings info I used in each case, but it would<br>have been too technical for most readers, and for some cases that wasn’t even feasible:<br>In Vray that would mean telling the subdivisions (samples) I set for each<br>materials, for the lights, for the sampler, the integrators’ settings (you can<br>use 2 at the same time)…</p><p>If you have any other question, please feel free to ask here or to<br>contact me.</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Good point. I was curious about this as well.<br>I actually had nothing to do with the testing, so I've asked Greg and Dario (author and tester) to chime in when they can. Cheers!</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for taking time out to do this...<br>Though I am quite sure it is very very hard to emulate the same conditions for each of these renderers you guys did quite awesome.<br>The hair test is shocking...that is incredibly different.<br>To me this also shows Cycles actually holds its own out there...render times will only get faster with every release but the quality is well on the mark comparing to the others.<br>I wonder how Arnold compares in terms of speed...any ideas??<br></p>

<p>This is a very interesting read. Since I use Blender largely for hobby work, I'll probably stick with Cycles for now. It seems to do fairly well and I like how well it works in blender. However, it's nice to know there are other options out there. Good article for sure.</p>

<p>A possible addendum to the final renderer feature comparisons.  Luxrender supports light tweaking like Maxwell's multilight as well through lightgroups.  Its been awhile since I messed with Maxwell, but does it support recoloring the lighting as well?  Lux supports RGB and color temperature adjustments per-light after/during rendering.</p>

<p>Nice comparison. Each engine has its own strengths. People can chose the best one according their needs and what they want to render. <br>I really like the Koro eyes in V-ray, the fur in Maxwell. The couch in Octane.<br>Probably a dumb question, but why didn't Blender develop the Blender Internal instead? There's a CGCookie "PBR" tutorial using blender internal, and it the result is very good, imo. At least for metal renders.</p>

<p>If I recall, I remember reading that Blender Internal's focus (or a fork's focus) will be NPR renders.  Think Freestyle but for your fills instead of lines/contours.  Although I may be confusing that for BEER (<a href="http://blendernpr.org/)" rel="nofollow">http://blendernpr.org/)</a></p>

<p>Hi Blenderguru team, this was a very interesting article and reminds me of the trials to measure Internet speed to compare ISPs back in the 90's. But joking aside, I think it is good to see that open source can deliver results of comparable quality - and 10% render time deviation to me looks like a non-issue, especially as I can use GPU for some cases to speed things up or invest time in heavy scene optimisation. To me it confirms that as an enthusiast I can stay happily with Cycles and have one learning curve. Pro's have to look at more platforms simply due to industry requirements.</p>

<p>For the interior scene, VRAY looked a bit cartoonish on the lamp, and it lacked shadows! I don't know if you messed up the lightning, or if it just wants to be the rebel, and light the scene differently, but if the lights were set up similarly, than VRAY screwed up big time. I would say that Maxwell won that one. Cycles still has a way to go before it reaches rendering times like the others, but its getting there.</p>

<p>Good article for provoking thought. I was a bit dissapointed to see that the glass materials on all but the maxwell and v-ray car scenes, wasn't set up properly (you made a perfect mirror material for cycles, lux, mitsubi &amp; octane).<br>A car scene will ideally have a proper glass material involved. The incorrect glass materials probably helped with the rendering speed of the renderers with those incorrect materials.</p><p>Thanks for the article though. Will be good to see a version 2. with Renderman involved in a couple of months (if possible!)</p>

<p>Nicely done, Dario.  Of course people will want more information to better understand your tests and might even be sensitive to their personal preferences.  It's understandable - especially when there is a fair amount of subjectivity in the conclusions.  But either way, you did a nice job on this.  Thanks for publishing.</p>

<p>Thank you, I’m glad you think that.</p><p>Yeah, my approach was to try and get somewhat similar results, no matter how<br>many samples. That involved rendering each scene a couple of dozens of times<br>with different settings, different amount of samples, analyzing and comparing<br>them each time.</p>

<p>Hi Angel, the standard amount of memory on the 970 is 4GB.  If you are trying to render a scene that requires more than 4GB, you will run out and receive that message.  Unfortunately, you will have to switch to CPU rendering unless you have a second GPU installed that has more memory (e.g. Titan Black).</p><p>I should clarify that GPU rendering will not take advantage of the 16GB of RAM that is on your motherboard.  Hence the limitation.</p>

<p>What a nice article.</p><p>Comming from maya, lightwave, thea render, maxwell, etc. I switched to blender for 2 years now and I have to say it does everything you need for production... I hardly see any reason to spend my money on an external rendering engine. Cycles + Freestyle(this with grease pencil.. who can really compete here?) is all you ever need.</p><p>Also I don't understand people complaining about render times in cycles... I regularly see renders with render times like... hours... sample count thru the roof and then I think: WTF is this guy doing? I could easily tweak for less then an hour or even minutes with comparable/acceptable/usable results.</p><p>So you guessed it by now: Blender(cycles and freestyle) all the way for me! :)</p>

<p>Just want to point out that you can't really compare different renders that produce different results.  In order to do a real comparison you would have to tune each render to produce as close to the same result as possible (for example amount of noise, color constancy etc) otherwise there are no controls in your test.  This article <a href="http://blog.boxxtech.com/2014/10/02/gpu-rendering-vs-cpu-rendering-a-method-to-compare-render-times-with-empirical-benchmarks/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.boxxtech.com/2014/...</a> talks a little bit about how to compare render results.  I feel like this article should be re-posed with a more empirical approach so we can properly asses the data.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comparison. If you make another one I hope it includes information about volumetrics, subsurface scattering and that stuff. Having trouble getting good lighting on a scene is how I found this article, and it was so interesting I read the whole thing. I've used v-ray with 3ds max before, but never tested anything but that and cycles, now I wanna try lux.</p>
